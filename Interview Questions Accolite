Q1. Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
 An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. 
 You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water. 
  Input: 11110 11010 11000 00000 Output: 1
  
 Q2. Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. 
  The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
  
 Q3. An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value 
  of the image (from 0 to 65535).  Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel 
  (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.  '
  To perform a “flood fill”, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally 
  to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected
   4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. 
   Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the new color.
    In the end, return the modified image
